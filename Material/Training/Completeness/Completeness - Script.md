We now ask you to reflect on the vocabulary with respect to its completeness. Do you think that the vocabulary contains all the concepts and relationships needed for classifying interesting facts about the case or cases you studied? In other words is the vocabulary complete? Or is it that more concepts or relationships need to be added to the vocabulary, in order to fully describe such cases?

You will specifically be asked to rate how much you agree or disagree with the statement that the set of concepts or relationships included in the vocabulary are sufficient for characterizing relevant parts of the described cases. And that, no more concepts or relationships need to be added to the set to make it more complete. The more you agree with the statement the more you believe that the set of concepts or relationships is indeed complete. The less you agree with the statement the more you believe that key concepts or relationships are missing from the vocabulary.
