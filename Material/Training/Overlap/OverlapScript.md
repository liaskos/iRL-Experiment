Before we start with the main exercises, we would like to know if you think there are overlaps between pairs of the concepts and relationships you were just presented. We offer the pairs below. For each pair, rate how much you think the two concepts in the pair overlap, i.e., refer to the same thing. Choose any level from 0 to 10, between No Overlap (0, they concepts in the pair are completely distinct) and Complete Overlap (10, the concepts in the pair refer to the same thing in different words). 

For example, I am asked here if “Furniture” and “Activity” have any overlap and I cannot observe any; there are no things that are both Furniture and Activity, these are completely different unrelated concepts. However, if I am asked if “Smart” and “Intelligent” have an overlap I would say yes: there are things that if you classify them under Smart you are likely to also classify them under Intelligent and vice versa; the terms have a very similar if not the same meaning.

But how about the concepts and relationships of the language we just discussed? Do you see any overlaps between those concepts and relationships? You can review the language again by referring to the video or to a cheat-sheet we have created for the purpose.
