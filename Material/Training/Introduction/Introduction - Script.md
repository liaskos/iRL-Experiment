Thank you for agreeing to participate in this experiment. In the screens that follow we are asking you to evaluate a **vocabulary** for describing human intentions. The vocabulary is simply **a set of words** to be used as the basis for constructing a conceptual modeling language. Conceptual modeling languages are often used in information technology (IT) for accurately describing and communicating IT problems and solutions. We want you to help us decide if the vocabulary of a conceptual modeling language that we are designing is well chosen or not. You will perform the following tasks:

You will first watch a video that presents the vocabulary. Then we will ask you some questions about the vocabulary to ensure good understanding of it. We will also ask your opinion about overlaps between the elements of the vocabulary.

Then you will perform the main exercise for this experiment. You will specifically use the vocabulary to characterize various situations and facts taken from one or more scenarios. Once you are done with that, you will offer your opinion about the relevance and completeness of the vocabulary. In the end we will ask you for some demographic information and for some feedback to help us improve this instrument. Whenever you are ready please continue to the next screen.
