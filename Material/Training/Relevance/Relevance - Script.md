Thank you for completing the main exercise(s). In the next two pages we will ask your opinion about the language and its concepts. In this page we are concerned with the _relevance_ of each concept or relationship. Specifically, based on the parts of the cases that you classified in the previous two screens, how relevant do you think each concept turned out to be for classifying those parts? 

For example, if “Vegetable” were used as a concept to classify parts, it would not be relevant, because none of the words and phrases you classified described a vegetable. So we move the slider accordingly. And clearly the concept “Vegetable” is not relevant for the case or cases that you studied. But how about the vocabulary concepts and relationships we have been discussing so far? Are these relevant? Help us find out by responding below.
