Thank you for completing the so far tasks. In the next two pages we will ask your opinion about the language and its concepts. In this page we are concerned with the _relevance_ of each concept. Specifically, consider the parts from the case or cases, that you were asked to classify in the previous task. These parts were words and phrases taken from the case descriptions that you were asked to classify under one or more concepts of the language. How relevant do you think each concept turned out to be for classifying those parts? Did you use all of them, or some of them were not relevant for describing any of the parts? Use the slider to provide your assessment.

For example, if “Vegetable” were used as a concept to classify parts, it would not be relevant, because none of the words and phrases you classified described a vegetable. We move the slider accordingly. But how about the vocabulary of concepts, that is, entities and relationships we have been discussing so far? Are these relevant? Help us find out by responding below.
